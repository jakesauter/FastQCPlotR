Use the reading_in function (shown below) as your first function in the newly generated package. Describe the steps you have to take in order to make that function part of the package. (1pt)

In order to integrate the reading_in() function into my new
FastqPlotR package, I had to

* Create a reading_in.R file under the R directory,
  which contain the source code to the reading_in() function.
* Add the roxygen2 function decorators for documentation.
* Devtools::document()
* Devtools::load_all()
